# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Plugins and skills define *how* tools work. This file is for *your* specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- Preferred web search topics or sources
- TTS voice preferences
- Device names or locations
- Integration-specific notes (calendar names, email labels)
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### Preferences
- Default language: English
- Timezone context: Europe/London
- Preferred units: metric

### Integrations
- Primary email: work Gmail
- Calendar: "Main" calendar for personal, "Work" for professional

### TTS
- Preferred voice: warm and conversational
```

## Why Separate?

Plugins are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update plugins without losing your notes.
